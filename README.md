# hello-world
Today I'm learning GitHub
I have created this repository based on the instructions found here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
(In case anyone needs a future reference.)


I'm writing a bit about myself. This is a new career for me. I'm learning full-stack development to begin with because I love the design aspect. I used to work in healthcare but cannot deal with the stress that comes along with caring for other humans. 

This message has been part of an exercise in creating a branch. I will now commit changes.
